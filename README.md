# interactive-animations

![Animation Demo Gif](demo.gif)

This project is an example of how to use `UIViewPropertyAnimator` to create interactive animations.
This was originally created as a demo to accompany I talk I gave at an Austin iOS developer meetup in September, 2017.

The repository's commits are structured in a way to show the various phases of building the animation.
In the original talk, I would jump between commits to gradually introduce concepts.

The animation is inspired by a WWDC 2017 presentation titled "Advanced Animations with UIKit".
